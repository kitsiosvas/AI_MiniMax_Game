# AI_MiniMax_Game
A Java 2-player game, where the player plays against the algorithm. Each party tries to make the opposing one to run out of moves.
The one that is about to play and has no moves left, loses.

First the progamm asks for the dimensions of the board. A 4x4 or 5x5 size is good for demonstration since larger sizes will take longer time to calculate the moves.
Valid moves are: "up", "right", "down", "left", "up_right", "up_left", "down_right", "down_left". A number is also required to specify how many spaces you want to travel
towards that direction.
